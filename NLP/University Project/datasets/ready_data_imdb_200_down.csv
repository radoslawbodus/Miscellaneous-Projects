happy holidays," ""Happy Holidays"" is a film that takes a comedic look at what happens when three childhood friends unexpectedly reunite in their Connecticut hometown right before Christmas. It's a story about growing up, growing apart, and eventually finding common ground. It's also about perception vs. reality, and how more often than not we make things much more difficult for ourselves than they need to be. In the film, the lead characters have conflicting perspectives on life: Alden is a recent convert to Judaism. He currently lives in Chicago, but is constantly on the move. Alden has major commitment issues. Kirby is a staunch Catholic, who uses his faith to justify his moral lapses. Kirby is in town from Baltimore, where he lives with his wife and kids. And Patrick still lives in his parents' house in Connecticut (which he purchased from them; they live in Maine.) A self-proclaimed Atheist, Patrick is also one of the only openly gay men in town. Patrick's parents, coincidentally, have major issues with the fact that he's gay (or so he thinks...). The story really centers on Patrick, whose life is becoming more and more complicated, especially around the holidays. Not only is he dealing with his parents' lack of acceptance for his lifestyle (or his own perception of their lack of his acceptance), but he is also trying to figure out where his relationship stands with his partner, Kevin. Should he stay with Kevin? Should he continue living in his parents' house? What does he want to do with his life? Patrick conveniently puts these issues on hold while he attempts to help his friends with their problems. Alden arrives a day before Christmas Eve. He is running from his longtime girlfriend who has just proposed to him. Kirby arrives the same day, but he's in town for his estranged father's funeral. Patrick and his friends spend the next forty-eight hours trying to relive the past. In doing so, they ultimately discover that the past isn't exactly as they remembered. They literally dig up old memories in the form of a time capsule, and with the help of a bottle of Patrick's uncle's wine, an old copy of TV Guide, and the effervescent music of Billy Ocean, the guys are transported back to the 1980s. But, the reality of the present is more powerful than any fond recollection of the past. Finding themselves stuck in the present, they must come to terms with who they are now, not only as friends, but also as adults. ""Happy Holidays"" is a story about perception, personal beliefs, and in the end, acceptance. It's funny, thought provoking, and moving, but also poignant, and at times, hilarious. The holidays will never be the same!",comedy

The Tophams have lived in Dunmow for fifteen years, but are still seen as outsiders by the Dunmow traditionalists, especially Miss Rosabelle Honeycroft, the elder domineering sister of the mild-mannered vicar, Hayworth Honeycroft. That is why Miss Honeycroft is so irked that Marjorie Topham has nominated her son, Basil Topham, and Basil's wife, Julie Topham, as the only entrants in this year's Flitch.

Basil and Julie didn't want to enter the Flitch as it places their life under a microscope. The lives of the Tophams and of all the men in town are turned upside down with the arrival of the Topham's new housekeeper, the exotically beautiful Marta, a Hungarian who had ulterior motives for wanting the job and who has expensive and refined tastes.

Miss Honeycroft's attempts to disqualify Basil and Julie from the Flitch for any reason, Marta kissing Basil and whether anyone saw, and the missing flitch (which was pilfered but many who feel directly responsible for what they believe is them losing it) add to the confusion as the trial proceeds.",comedy

vola vola," VolaVola is a choral story that tells various facets of contemporary lifestyles, comparing feelings and world views of three different generations. The underlying assumption of the film is that the use of certain media, affects the definition of needs and aspirations of choice, for those who benefit. Although it is a drama, VolaVola exudes confidence for the future. The story clearly shows the hope that we are living the last days of a long winter, and that the value system on which the Internet generation is founded will help make the world a better place. Although it will be starring avatars, VolaVola is a visceral film about human beings, an invitation to be alive and alert, to always have your own and new vision about things.

a little piece of sunshine," Sunshine, an idyllic and almost forgotten island under British rule, is shortly to become independent. But a few days before this event is to take place, the British governor of the island is shot. Her Majesty's secret service is called in and Sam McCready asks Desmond Hannah of Scotland Yard to take charge of the case. When Hannah arrives on Sunshine, he notices the subdued atmosphere of fear reigning there. An aggressive presidential election campaign is being conducted, but neither of the two candidates appears to be very trustworthy. The attractive widow Lady Beatrix Coltrane tells Hannah that most of the island's inhabitants are not looking forward to independence because they fear that either of the two candidates for the presidency will abuse the island for his own benefit. One of them, Tomson, is probably involved in illegal drug-peddling in connection with the Colombian Medellin cartel; the other one, Livingstone, is said to be collaborating with the Cuban government. Lady Beatrix' representations are confirmed by Reverend Drake, the island's priest, whom Hannah also discovers to be a strict opponent of independence. Ernie Favaro, a policeman from Miami, arrives on Sunshine. He is investigating the murder of one of his colleagues by members of the Medellin cartel. A hot trail has brought him to the island. The two cases could be connected, and Hannah and Favaro agree to collaborate. But as they have no official permission to carry on their investigations, they are in constant danger of being arrested by the local chief constable, himself suspected of corrupt behaviour. Shortly after the two policemen called on Tomson, one of the candidates for the presidency, somebody tries to kill them. But they are able to intercept and arrest the gunner. To their surprise, he is none other than Reverend Drake. He claims to have missed the target on purpose, intending to draw the attention of the international press to the precarious political situation on the island. After the arrest of Reverend Drake, the chief constable at last has a pretext for apprehending Hannah and Favaro for illegal possession of firearms. But suddenly, to everybody's surprise, Sam McCready arrives on the scene and identifies himself as the interim governor of the island. He takes charge of the case himself. Lady Beatrix makes certain insinuations which lead Hannah to conjecture that she is the perpetrator of the governor's death. Her motive, like Drake's, appears to have been to draw inter-national attention to Sunshine. But Hannah has no proof for his theory. Meanwhile, Ernie Favaro believes to have found a hot scent in the case of his murdered colleague. When he had called on candidate Tomson, he had noticed a valuable edition of Milton's ""Paradise Lost"". This is the book his murdered collegue had mentioned in connection with the Medellin cartel. Favaro is able to convince governor Sam McCready that Tomson's house must be searched. But the governor prefers the elegant British solution and pays an official first visit to Tomson. This gives Favaro the opportunity to pocket the book. In it, he finds a microfilm with incriminatory data such as the names, bank accounts, business partners, funds etc. of the Medellin cartel. Tomson is shot when he tries to leave Sunshine. The presidential election is postponed until further notice. Sam McCready, who has already become used to the comforts of a diplomat's life, drinks to Lady Beatrix health on her veranda. He is quite willing to let sleeping dogs lie where the death of his predecessor is concerned, and to ask the widow no further questions...",thriller

All this changes when he gets a visit one day from a friend: Marcus Holt, the very wealthy owner of an enormous diamond company. Kessel-bach and Holt have not seen each other for many years. Kesselbach now lives in Brandenburg, and Holt in South Africa. Back then they were very close friends, until they fell in love with the same woman, Julia, whom Holt later married. Julia is also the reason why Holt has come to see his old friend. He is worried about his wife, who has had serious psychological problems for a while now; he tells Kesselbach that she is addicted to tablets. Holt says he just can't seem to get through to her anymore. A few weeks ago she disappeared, and now Holt is pin-ning all his hopes on Kesselbach: perhaps he can win Julia's trust and bring her back home. Painful memories of the old days resurface in Kesselbach at the mention of Julia's name. He has never been able to forget her. Back then he never had the courage to tell Julia about his own true feelings for her, preferring instead to withdraw, cutting off all contact with Julia and Holt. Julia, deeply hurt, decided to marry Holt, who also truly loved her. Holt furnishes Kesselbach with credit cards and a mobile phone and sends him to Berlin, where he thinks Julia might be. He tells Kesselbach to make contact with her there. And it doesn't take long before Kesselbach finds Julia, who is staying in the most expensive hotel in the city under an assumed name. He addresses Julia, pretending that their meeting is quite coincidental. Julia can hardly believe it when she sees Kesselbach again: full of joy she embraces her old friend, and very soon the two of them are deep in reminiscences about the old times. But Kessel-bach can sense Julia is not well: she's tired and nervous, and clearly taking medi-cation. Eventually she confesses to him that her marriage to Holt is sheer hell for her, and that she filed for divorce long ago but Holt didn't want to let her go. She tells Kesselbach that Holt is a brutal, power-crazed person who even had a psychi-atric report on her forged so that he could make her even more dependent on him. Kesselbach is utterly shocked at this, and can hardly believe what Julia is tell-ing him. Is she ill? Or under the influence of drugs? Shortly afterwards Julia hurriedly leaves the hotel after she discovers that Kessel-bach is working for her husband. She races to the airport to catch the next plane to South Africa. Kesselbach finds out about Julia's departure in the nick of time, and travels after her. In Kimberley Kesselbach sees Julia meet a shabby and sinister-looking man. What is she planning? Shortly afterwards Kesselbach strikes up a conversation with the man, whose name is Vanhooten. The man tells Kesselbach about the history of the diamond mining business in South Africa, in which he himself was employed for many years. Another confrontation occurs between Julia and Kesselbach. Julia urgently asks Kesselbach for help. She knows that her husband is engaged in shady business dealings in the diamond industry and that he is tricking the diamond cartel, and she says she is busy gathering evidence against him. She will only be free of him once she finally has it. Kesselbach is torn # whom should he believe? His old friend Holt or the great love of his life Julia, who has lost none of the fascination she exercised on him all those years ago? Julia also feels just as attracted to Kessel-bach # and that night the two of them make passionate love. Their happiness is short-lived, however # because the next day, Holt drives up out-side the hotel # with Julia as his passenger! He invites Kesselbach to accompany him and Julia to his farm outside the city. Kesselbach is in a desperate situation: he has tricked his friend, and rediscovered the woman he always loved. But can he believe Julia? For dinner, Julia is forced to wear the ""Stone of Light"", one of the most expensive diamonds of the world. Holt once bought it for her, but she never really wanted it. For Julia, the necklace is a symbol for her being tied to Holt who regards her as his possession. Since Julia believes that an amulet Holt always used to wear and Holt's wealth are directly related to one another, she wants to discover the secret. Following some old tips from Vanhooten they set off in search of an aboriginal tribe. On the way there they pass through an old African village, where they are given valuable in-formation about the tribe. These people live near a magic river and own the amu-let. Kesselbach finally believes in Julia's story... Kesselbach therefore agrees on going back to Kimberley to meet Vanhooten. A short while later Kesselbach is holding in his hands the small package that Van-hooten had been keeping for Julia. He also finds out that Vanhooten once worked for Holt, and considers his ex-boss to be a cold-blooded, calculating indi-vidual. Shortly after Kesselbach's departure Vanhooten is shot dead.

viskningar och rop," In turn-of-the-century Sweden, cancer-stricken, dying Agnes is visited in her isolated rural mansion by her sisters Karin and Maria. As Agnes' condition deteriorates and pain management becomes increasingly more difficult, fear and revulsion grip the sisters, who seem incapable of empathy, and Agnes' only comfort and solace comes from her maid Anna. As the end draws closer, long repressed feelings of grudging resentment and mistrust cause jealousy, selfishness, and bitterness between the siblings to surface. It's the turn of the nineteenth into twentieth centuries in Sweden. The interrelationships between four adult women - sisters Agnes, Karin and Maria, and Agnes' longtime housemaid Anna - are presented. Karin and Maria, both married, have returned to the family country manor estate, where they stay on occasion as they lead their lives, to watch over Agnes, who is on her deathbed, suffering in pain from the final throes of her illness. Karin and Maria's return is despite the three sisters having an unspoken strained and standoffish relationship with each other. Cold and stern Karin is all repressed emotions as she hides behind a proper decorum, those repressed emotions including a hatred for her diplomat husband, Fredrik. Self-absorbed Maria is the quietly but calculatingly sexual one, her slight smiles and furtive glances only noticed by her lovers, who include David, Agnes' doctor. In her spontaneous cries of pain for assistance, Agnes calls out for Anna instead of her sisters. Agnes does call out for her sisters when she has the forethought to think about what is happening. Devout Anna, who has experienced pain herself in that her daughter died years earlier in infancy, is the only one who provides unconditional love and support to Agnes, both in comforting her in life and also in death. The focus on Agnes provides the opportunity most specifically for the three sisters to confront their relationship demons with each other. A family drama takes place in a mansion in the late 1800's. Karin and Maria watch over their sister Agnes' sickbed together with the servant Anna. Through flashbacks the lives of both sisters are described, which are full of lies, deceit, callousness, self despise, guilt and forbidden love.

ayiti mon amour," A grieving young boy discovers he has a superpower. An old fisherman realizes the cure for his ailing wife can be found in the sea. A muse struggles to exit the story her author is penning. In Guetty Felin's magical neorealist tale, these three stories combine to create a poetic portrait of the island nation Haiti. Set five years after the devastating 2010 earthquake, Felin's film eschews the images that saturated screens after the disaster. While the pain of the destruction remains evident - in young Orphée's grief over the loss of his father, in the rubble of decimated buildings, in ghostly images that float beneath the ocean's surface - Felin refuses to tell a tale of victimhood. Instead, she places the island's narrative back in the hands of Haitians whose lives aren't reducible to headlines. And as her characters begin to heal, Felin suggests that the island will too. Felin taps into her past work in the documentary field, infusing the realities of modern-day Haiti with a lyrical touch. From its verité-style moments of Jaures the fisherman labouring by the beach to the theatrical scenes between muse Ama and her author, the film makes its fluid tonal shifts at a lulling, rhythmic pace. Shot on location with local actors and crew, Felin's film is an important addition to the body of work coming out of Haiti's burgeoning film scene. Ayiti Mon Amour doesn't just mark the emergence of a distinct new directorial voice; it's a key development in the evolution of a national cinema. A grieving teenager discovers he has a superpower.

todliches geld," Béatrice Belmont is attractive - and a successful business woman who has built up her career on her own. A lot of things would have been simpler if she had taken advantage of the good name of her ex-husband, the younger heir of the Geneva-based Belmont Bank. She now directs an investment fund specializing in art. Regularly visiting auctions, there she meets Robert, a lawyer, who enchants her with his charm. Even after being divorced from her husband Michael Béatrice her former father-in-law Paul Belmont has always remained her friend. When his older son and designated successor Albert is killed in a sports accident, the line of succession in the family is bitterly contested. His two daughters have hopes for their husbands in this connection. Carlo, husband of the older daughter Anita, is the manager of the department for the bank's private customers, while Léon, husband of the family's baby Lucy, manages a subsidiary of the bank. Paul, however, is in agreement with the attorney Viktor Lepka, his right hand, that Béatrice, with her dynamic but understanding flair, is more suited than anyone else to take over Albert's position. Béatrice appreciates this evidence of trust but asks Paul for time to consider. She cannot completely change her life from one day to the next. Besides, in her opinion her ex-husband Michael would be much better suited to assume the management of the bank. And this seems to her to be the ideal basis for a reconciliation between father and son after years of feuding. Despite Béatrice's mediation, however, Paul and Michael have a violent dispute again. Michael storms out of his father's office in a rage. Only now, after her plan has failed, does Béatrice begin thinking seriously about Paul's offer. Shortly afterwards, after learning that the attorney Viktor Lepka has committed suicide, her decision is definite: she will begin working for the Belmont Bank. Already on the following day Béatrice pays the Belmont subsidiary Arcus a visit. She asks Fallon, Paul's judiciary adviser, to help her investigate the reasons for Lepka's death. Together, the two quickly find out that Lepka had been involved in shady transactions and that he broke down under pressure. At the same time they discover that Arcus has suffered losses amounting to thousands of millions in the past months under the management of Paul's son-in-law Léon. But even after an intensive search they cannot locate Léon. Paul immediately convenes a family conference. News arrived heralding a new disaster. Interpol, namely, has begun investigating the bank for laundering money. There is a witness in New York willing to give State's evidence against the bank: Léon, who, by doing this, wants to gain exemption from punishment for his own appropriations. Béatrice knows that Paul would never misuse the bank for laundering money. However, to her own and Paul's horror they ascertain that a numbered account does exist under the name of Paul's brother Monsignore Francis Belmont living in America. Although the pertinent documents have mysteriously vanished Béatrice and Fallon, now almost inseparable, discover that dubious deals have indeed been transacted through this account. The connections involving the account lead not only to mailbox companies but even to the Vatican itself. While Béatrice continues investigating the background of the numbered account Paul meets with other bankers in Geneva. The latter refuse, though, to grant the Belmont Bank credit to deflect its losses. Paul finally collapses under the tension and suffers a heart attack. Because of Paul's illness the Belmont family threatens to fall apart. But through Béatrice's mediation Michael now takes over the management of the bank after all. His prestige in the world of finance gains the Belmont Bank a reprieve from the creditors and the prosecuting attorney's office. In the meantime Béatrice and Fallon have continued pursuing the paths of the illegal money. They skilfully reveal that a secret international organization has made use of the account to launder its money. Monsignore Francis, misled by his ambition to become a cardinal, has allowed his name to be used. By obtaining desperately needed money thanks to these dirty deals, he managed to make himself indispensable to the Vatican. No one there learned of the money's source. Béatrice, Michael and Paul, on the road to recovery, use this information to save the bank. During a meeting Paul and Francis have a bitter exchange of words. The banker succeeds in negotiating credit with the Vatican bank, thus making the family enterprise solvent once again. Aside from that, he demands that Francis use his influence to prevent the witness from giving State's evidence. Béatrice is a horrified witnesses to this agreement. She knows that Paul, by doing this, has engineered Léon's death sentence. Although her entreaties fall on deaf ears, she desperately attempts to change the banker's mind. To save his bank, Paul is determined to stop at nothing. His triumph is only short-lived, however. He suffers a second heart attack. Béatrice is not able to prevent Paul's fatal transaction. But despite an attractive offer from Michael she does not wish to profit from its fruit, either, and turns her back on the world of big business.",crime

Some days later and Jack Taylor is returning to his beloved Galway after having been away for a year. Jack is clean and sober. Now he's back, off the booze and determined to stay away from trouble; determined not to get sucked back into the cycle of death and violence again. Jack's resolve not to take on any jobs is immediately tested when the dead man's mother who knows Jack begs for his help. To complicate Jack's investigation, an enthusiastic young man, Cody, who hero-worships Jack as the best private eye in Ireland, shows up on his doorstep, wanting to be Jack's new partner in private investigations. Jack tells him to get lost. Worse, though, his old flame from ""The Guards"", the woman he still carries a torch for, Ann Hennessey comes back into his life when he least needs it. She is now in a relationship with a successful businessman - who also happens to beat her up. Jack is enraged, wants nothing more than to tear the guy's heart out. Jack then uncovers a group of vigilantes calling themselves The Pikemen, after old Irish Freedom Fighters, local men who are sick of what Galway has become and want to return to the way Galway used to be: A safe city, governed by The Twelve Tribes, who meted out justice to anyone who overstepped their mark. Realizing that Jack is close to cracking the case, The Pikemen offer Jack to join them. He is, after all, just like them: Hates injustice and sometimes metes out his own brand of justice. But Jack refuses. Then another murder is committed - Ann Hennessey's husband - and suddenly Jack finds himself the main suspect, with all the evidence pointing at him. Inspector Clancy has him arrested. Jack realizes that nobody believes his innocence, not Ann Hennessey who now never wants to see him again; not Clancy and even Kate thinks he did it. The naive, enthusiastic Cody is Jack's only ally. Jack escapes from custody and is forced to go on the run. With time running out and the net closing around him he must find the killer and prove his own innocence - before he is caught and convicted. Jack is pushed to the brink like never before. His very soul is at stake. By the end he realizes that the only way to see justice done is to do the very thing he has been trying to avoid: To become like the Pikemen.",crime

mr. lockjaw," Mr. Lockjaw is an American drama series created by Justin Craig and Byron Conrad Erwin. Set and produced in Atlanta, Georgia, Mr. Lockjaw is the story of Miles Brimley (Troy Halverson), a struggling children's entertainer who is dragged into the underworld of criminal interrogation and torture by his deranged dummy, Mr. Lockjaw. Finding his hole dug deeper and deeper, Miles has no choice but to give in to Mr. Lockjaw's increasingly dangerous desires. A glimmer of hope appears for him in Gwyneth, a recovering drug addict who hopes that her childhood bond with Miles can help her escape painful memories. Miles and Lockjaw's situation is further complicated by the crumbling empire of their once powerful employer, Hubaldus Hercolani; his number one in command, Leonard Stanley; and a blackmailed police officer, Bill Preslin. If that weren't enough to contend with, Detective Schafley, a by the book gumshoe, is pulled into a murder case with Miles as the prime suspect... or should that be Mr. Lockjaw? There are two sides to every story, and Mr. Lockjaw takes this literally. A children's entertainer by day, ventriloquist Miles Brimley moonlights as an information extractor for the criminal world run by the infamous Herbaldus Hercolani. With a lead character reminiscent of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the series takes viewers into a splintered world of a duplicitous characters struggling between the light and dark. More than just a crime drama, it raises the ultimate human question: which side is really you? It is the story of a man surrounded by, and involved in, murder, criminal activity and corruption, but at the heart of it all he is seeking out the simple pleasures of life that most take for granted. His struggle is to survive his environment, his enemies, and most of all, the demands of his alter-ego, the larger-than-life puppet named Mr. Lockjaw. Filled with dry wit and glib satire, the show is not a comedy per se, but rather a dark spotlight that illuminates the ugliest side of our existence, while still recognizing the innate humor of the concept. Mr. Lockjaw uses its just South of realism premise to open up twisted possibilities that couldn't be done on a more grounded show. The more ordinary characters stand in for the audience as observers of the increasingly pulpy interrogation methods of Mr. Lockjaw. Every episode delivers another water-cooler moment of bizarre deaths, unforeseen twists, and memorable quips that could only emerge from a deranged dummy's mouth. In a world of duality, Mr. Lockjaw gleefully licks both sides of the double-edged sword.",crime

Until his death, he never knew that each of his children was struggling with the weight of bitter disappointments, missed opportunities, and regrets. Further, he was never truly aware of what they thought of their father and of their childhood in that rural town. And perhaps it took his passing -- and their subsequent return to their roots -- for the children to learn this for themselves. The love they discover their father had for them for so long sheds light onto what is truly important in their lives. While Richard is learning about his children, they are, in turn, learning more than they ever thought they would know about their old predictable dad. Despite their preconceived notions of what they believed he thought of them, as secrets and surprises are revealed, they discover that their father's love was deep and permeated his entire existence. Its redeeming quality brings them the best Christmas gift of all.",family

kid talk," ""Kid Talk"" was promoted as ""family-friendly"" programming in the early 1970's. Actually, ""Kid Talk"" ran opposite ABC's ""Juvenile Jury."" Then, programming by the only networks in that day, NBC, ABC, and CBS, made attempts to ""recover"" ""family-programming"" from the 1950's and the 1960's; however, they tried to accomplish this by promoting the ""kid's point-of-view,"" perhaps, to attempt to divert the public's attention from the more important issues of the day. Ultimately, neither ""Kid Talk"" nor ""Juvenile Jury"" fared well in ratings, primarily, due to the television viewers' other more obvious interests at that time (i.e., Watergate and Vietnam) and because in that day, the opinion of ""kids,"" truly, was not welcome (unlike today, then, ""kids"" were seen and not heard and that carried-through to television programming); consequently, both networks cancelled their respective ""kid host"" talk shows. It was not until a production hosted by Bill Cosby in the 2000's that the format reoriginated. (That series, too, did not fare well.) ""Kid Talk"" was a rare attempt by CBS to counter Sunday afternoon sports shows with original, family-friendly programming. The show itself was a bit of a curio; the children who were the regulars interviewed major celebrities, rather than the reverse (e.g. in one episode, one panel member asked one actress, whom I don't recall, if she likes to fight with her children). One of ""Kid Talk's"" resident panelists, 8-year-old Mona Tera (who was seen, in the opening titles, skipping around in silhouette to the jazzy flute theme song), became a minor celebrity herself; later in 1972 she made a cameo appearance on ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In."" None of the other regulars made it big in show business after this show ended in September 1972, and Ms. Tera faded from the public eye as well.",family

cheryomushki," The title of the film (literally ""Cherry Town"") refers to new towns or neighborhoods based on middle-class urban development, where every block of houses looks exactly the same as the next. In the Soviet Union of the late 1950s this was thought to be equivalent to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This musical involves the tribulations of four couples whose lives humorously intersect. It opens with Sergei, a driver, meeting up with his good friend Boris. After lamenting being alone, Boris falls head over heals for a museum guide, Lida. She resists his advances but that doesn't stop Boris. She leads him to her friends, Masha and Sasha, who are planning to get married and are elated to have recently received permission to move into an apartment in the Moscow Cheryomushki. On her way home (with Boris constantly tagging along), Lida discovers along with her father that the roof of their apartment has collapsed and is now uninhabitable. After some amazingly quick work, they receive permission to move into the same Cheryomushki. Working as a steam shovel engineer at this Cheryomushki is Lyusya, who is Sergei's girlfriend. She also has just obtained an apartment there and is waiting to hear the question that Sergei is too shy to ask. Sergei takes Boris, Lida, and her father to the Cheryomushki, ignoring the job for which he was hired, being a taxi to Vava, a Fellini-esque no-nonsense but playful buxom woman and her husband, Drebednev. Drebednev is the corrupt real estate manager who gives (or more often doesn't give) permission for people to take an apartment in the Cheryomushki. Additionally, Vava is a friend of Boris. To make Vava happier, Boris convinces Drebednev to expand their 2-bedroom apartment into a 4-room apartment. But when he breaks down the walls, he has to evict the tenants in the next apartment, Lida and her father. They are heartbroken and have to now worry about going through the long process of receiving another apartment. Meanwhile, as Masha and Sasha move in, they discover that none of their neighbors have keys, so they all spend an evening of singing and dancing in Masha's and Sasha's apartment. Realizing Lida's plight, Boris suggests to Vava that two 2-bedroom apartments are better than one 4-bedroom apartment. Drebednev returns the aparment to Lida and her father, is unmasked as a bureaucrat, and Vava chooses to get a divorce. Finally, through the help of a bench, Sergei gets the courage to ask Lyusya to marry him. In the end of the film, Lida still rejects Boris, who is one of the crewmen detonating Drebednev's old office. He picks the petals of a daisy (""she loves me, she loves me not"") when the detonation goes off, thrusting him up several floors on to Lida's terrace, and presumably to a happy end for all.",musical

"wallis simpson, loved and lost"," Was she an adventurer, a femme fatale or a victim? We present a truthful portrait of an unusual life. To this day, Wallis Simpson divides opinion; but whether hated or adored, she will always be the woman who stole a king from the British people and threw their monarchy into crisis. A twice-married American, and then Duchess of Windsor, Wallis Simpson was not permitted to travel to England and was completely shunned by the royal family. For some she is a witch who cast a spell on the handsome prince, while others identify with her because the man she loved gave up everything for her. We attempt to sort the myth from the truth. Without doubt, Wallis was the reason that Edward VIII abdicated the British throne. This made her the most vilified woman of the 20th century. The British public, in particular, were merciless in their contempt and scorn. There were accusations that the marriage was illegal, that she was a nymphomaniac, a whore, even a sex-athlete, who had learned her trade in the brothels of China. Rumours of everything from working for the German Reich's secret service through to having an affair with the Nazi foreign minister von Ribbentrop abounded. But what is the truth? Where does this aversion come from? Could the relationship between Edward and Wallis Simpson even have been a good opportunity for the British government to rid itself of an unpopular monarch? Having grown up in rather modest circumstances, was Wallis striving for financial security? Was she a dangerous adventurer, who used her close relationship with the British king to rise in society? Or was she a victim - caught in a relationship that the entire world was watching? This film presents a truthful portrait of an unusual life.",biography

Animated by a docile but determined nature, despite her father's will, she falls in love and decides to marry Prince Filippo D'Assia. The King, who does not approve the union of his daughter, a Catholic, with a German and protestant aristocratic, receives strong signals of disapproval from the Pope and Mussolini. The marriage of Mafalda and Filippo is rewarded by the birth of four children, but the historical situation - Fascism, the advent of Nazism and the imminent war - deprive the family of its usual serenity. Filippo spends most of his time in Germany, at Hitler's service, and Mafalda - who does not approve either of Mussolini or Nazism - is watched by the Gestapo.

lampedusa," Two people return to the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. Giulia overcame a personal crisis here, Zakaria fled here from the civil war in his homeland of Somalia. Schreiner tells about them, about innermost thoughts, existential questions and fears, about transiency: A search for meaning that remains fragmentary, moving between memory and now. The past presses into the monologues and conversations in the present of the cinematic image. It has written itself visibly into the skin, faces, and bodies that Schreiner explores in close ups, which become practically perceptible, yet nonetheless remain highly artificial. The strict, sensual beauty of these images, the play with abstraction of brilliant black-and-white, of light and shadow, the long, calm takes, the concentration on details all create the space for an intuitive, concentrated awareness, a space of encounter. The site of this encounter is concrete, but for the characters, the sparse, brittle landscape of Lampedusa turns into a stage of sorts, and a projection; an abstract space. Just as this island exists as a mere idea for most of us, as a place where political action becomes manifest, and also a crisis-the relationship of old Europe and young Africa, the dynamics of resistance and mesmerized attraction, of inside and outside. Schreiner drafts Lampedusa as a universal, internal narrative, as intense space of experience and association, oscillating between documentary and fictional elements. Freed of the necessity to explain, the film itself becomes a search and interrogation-of the characters, cinematic form, and our own present realities. A woman, a man. The island of Lampedusa, where their escape routes intersect. Zakaria, in his late twenties, from Somalia, who has risked his life coming to the island on a small boat when fleeing civil war in his country. Giulia, in her mid-fifties, a tourist from Northern Italy, on the run from deep personal crises. Both have returned to the island.",biography

puccini," Vienna, 1924: Puccini, the world-famous composer of operas finds a confidante in the journalist Liza Berman, who will accompany him on a trip into his past: The unrequited love he feels for Elvira, a married woman, who secretly returns his feelings. As a 20-year-old he is living in Milan, in bitter poverty, and barely struggles along as a musician, but upon finishing his studies he makes quite an impression. Full of hope he applies to take part in a contest for opera composers, but he is turned down. Puccini had firmly counted on winning the prize money and now faces financial straits. Thanks to the librettist Fontana, his one-act opera ""Le Villi"" is performed all the same. The established music publisher Ricordi now commissions Puccini to write the opera ""Edgar"", which turns out a flop. When Elvira leaves her husband to live with Puccini, the lovers are beset by feelings of guilt. Puccini begins to doubt himself, but due to Ricordi's support, Puccini can write in peace. Soon he triumphs in opera houses all over Europe with ""Manon Lescaut"", but Ricordi demands fresh supplies. A former lover, who used to be a dancer in the Cabaret, brings the novel ""Vie Bohčme"" to his attention, a subject, which his colleague Leoncavallo is already working on. But it is Puccini who prevails with Ricordi. When Puccini tries to get rid of the overbearing conductor Toscanini as well, Ricordi resists him. ""La Bohčme"" becomes a giant success under Toscanini's musical direction. As Puccini later gets stuck in his work at ""Tosca"" he waits for inspiration at night in shape of his muse Antilisa, a shy mythological animal. Again Puccini experiences a triumph. Always on the lookout for a new subject, a frustrated Puccini travels to London. There he accompanies his friend Sybil Seligman to the theatre, where ""Madame Butterfly"" electrifies him. Back in Italy, he develops a platonic relationship with the servant girl Doria. Elvira fires Doria and makes Puccini promise never to see her again. The young woman commits suicide. After initially failing in Milan, ""Madama Butterfly"" triumphs a few months and several changes later in other European cities. In Vienna, Elvira surprises Puccini with the journalist Liza Berman, but by that time Elvira's love is above the slights Puccini has inflicted on her over the years. She demands that Dr. Landauer thoroughly examines her husband, who is suffering from a chronic sore throat. The final diagnosis shows a malign tumor of the larynx. Meanwhile, the work on ""Turandot"" has ground to a halt. Liza takes him along to a concert of contemporary music, which he finds fascinating and unsettling at the same time, because it makes him feel that his own music sounds old-fashioned by comparison. While undergoing treatment at a Brussels hospital, Puccini confesses to Elvira that he blames himself for Doria's death. During a sleepless night he tosses the unfinished score to ""Turandot"" into the fireplace, but Elvira saves the manuscript. Puccini dies not long after-wards.

OYE tells the story of how the underbelly of a marginalized scene took to the streets of Miami and became a mainstay in dance, hip-hop, and music.

me and my health condition," I am an attorney at a large law firm in NYC and have a health condition that I would like to raise awareness for. I would like to raise awareness by doing some sort of art project, either a book, a song, but probably more likely one of those moth monologues or a traveling one man play. I am not a professional artist in any way, and certainly compared to whoever is reading this I am not an 'artist' yet, but I would like to finally pursue my creative side in making whatever this project ends up being. I will have a lot of issues to deal with in doing this: (1) the health issue itself, which affects every single solitary thing in my life (I can explain more details with a confidentiality agreement); (2) doing the project while also making sure I don't blow things at my current job by either doing some sort of ethical violation that gets me disbarred or by scaring away clients (or coworkers) because of my health condition, and (3) making sure that I do this whole 'awareness' thing the right way by trying to have the most or best impact that is in line with the consensus thinking about this health condition. Anyway, I really need a partner more than funding, although I'm sure I'll need funding too. So I guess I need money for all the film and cameras (unless someone I partner with already has them) and then maybe money to pay some assistants (this is why I need a partner). Anyway, thanks for reading this and your consideration! Please keep doing what you're doing!",documentary

"max frisch, citoyen"," After Friedrich Dürrenmatt and Niklaus Meienberg died, Max Frisch was the last of the big Swiss intellectuals actively pursuing this role and being perceived as such by those around him, both in Switzerland and abroad. Since his death in 1991, no other voices have emerged to replace him. On the contrary: in Switzerland, as in other countries, writers and thinkers have ceased to be a major influence on social issues and processes. Thus, the question arises whether their contribution is needed at all. The film ""The Voice of Max Frisch"" tells Frisch's story as a ""voice"", explaining how his active contribution to society developed and how this became an integral part of his entire life. While Frisch focuses on his personal situation, his perspective also reflects the history of the 20th century as a whole, which he experienced mostly in Switzerland and Germany and which he witnessed almost from the beginning to the end. Max Frisch's view, therefore, is a record of our most recent history, on which today's world is built. The substance of the film is taken from Frisch's own texts covering his entire career including his earliest works. They evolve into some form of lifetime account in the author's own words: from his initial astonishment in view of the world to the horror of war, from his ""awakening"" to the way he began to make his voice heard in public - which he continued to do until he died. Archive material of the times and events referred to by Frisch illustrate the author's accounts, amalgamating into his ""personal"" history of the 20th century. There is also footage of Max Frisch himself as well as current images, illustrating that Frisch's texts are no less topical today. In order to complement and contrast the Frisch perspective, fellow writers of the time provide their views, e.g. Peter Bichsel, Günter Grass, Christa Wolf, as well as several renowned politicians who knew Frisch personally, e.g. Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger. Finally, some of the author's close friends round off the film, bringing the writer's aura back to life. The interaction between the various aspects presented make it possible to follow Frisch's footsteps closely and intensively. And the key question - valid well beyond Max Frisch and Switzerland - keeps cropping up again: What role should intellectuals play in society? And why is it that the big thinkers keep so quiet today?",documentary

bridging the gap," The Vienna Boys' Choir, arguably the most famous boys' choir, and one of the oldest boy music group in the world, is a cultural phenomenon. The boys are immensely popular worldwide and sing to sell-out crowds wherever they perform. Curt Faudon's film explores the Choir's universal appeal. In Bridging the Gap the boys discuss on camera why people sing, why they sing. 'Singing makes you grin, you cannot help it,' says one of them, while another volunteers, 'Singing consoles me.' Lukas has to think a bit before he admits to liking wild applause best of all, because that way he knows the choir has done a good job. Ivan cannot think of anything but becoming an opera singer, and Thomas explains how singing makes him feel connected with himself and others. They agree you need to connect with your audience. If you do, you can pretty much bridge any gap. They put the theory to the test, singing to (and with) other children and adults, in New Zealand, in India, in the United States. They demonstrate that singing overcomes differences between people, but also space, and ultimately time. The camera follows the boys at home and on their international tours, discovering new songs en route. The boys are seen rehearsing and performing with musicians from around the world. Bridging the gap between religions, the boys sing Hindu, Apache, Ringatu, and Christian spiritual music. We witness auditions in Japan, and Singapore, we see the boys rehearse alone and in groups, we see and hear their voices and their personalities develop, we watch them perform. We get a good idea of how difficult it is to get ready for a performance, and how much work the boys and their tutors and coaches have to put in. Bridging the Gap affords the viewer a privileged look backstage; we experience how music is made: by making music visible, the film bridges the gap between the performers and their audience.",documentary
inheritance," In 2011, I realized that the DMV had misspelled my last name. This prompted me to search online and to my shock  books came up describing my father's role in the development of modern Iran. For the first time in my life all that seemed fact vanished.   So began a 4 year search for my identity as an Iranian American. I most vividly remember  witnessing at age nine one of the most tumultuous events in modern Iranian history: the CIA-led coup of 1953 that toppled Dr Mossadegh and installed the Shah. This event, virtually unknown to most Americans, not only shaped my life but the future course of events in 1979 Iran.  inheritance, weaves my personal story with the views of author, Stephen Kinzer, (All The Shah's Men) and historians, Ervand Abrahamian, (The Coup) and Mohammad Majd, (Britain and Reza Shah).

One comes to comprehend the deep rooted distrust of the US within the Iranian psyche and why the US and Iran fell so far apart. inheritance, is a film that provides historical perspective on Iran at a time in which such perspective -- at least here, in the United States -- is deeply needed, there is an opportunity to heal this wound and further the cause of peace and global stability.   I have been a documentary filmmaker for most of my adult life, but  inheritance is, quite literally, the film I was born to make.",documentary

Featuring live musical performances, freak shows, suspension acts and a skin-melting pyrotechnic stage show, House of Shock prepares its all-too-willing patrons for a horrifying gauntlet of monsters, demons and pure evil that leaves some crying, some laughing and some literally scared to death. HOS, filmed during House of Shock's 20th season, captures this bone-chilling experience from every angle and explores the subculture of the fear-obsessed through interviews with some of the biggest names in metal, hard rock and horror, as well as patrons, fans, dissenters and those who work behind the scenes to bring House of Shock and other horror content and attractions to life. No matter their walk of life, those who crave the rush of being afraid and those who dedicate themselves to creating ever more terrifying experiences for others are bound by their obsession with fear - and a family is born.",documentary

subberlin - underground united," The original Tresor was in many ways the quintessential Berlin club: located in an unrenovated vault beneath a bombed out department store, it opened its doors amidst the general confusion and ecstasy that swept across the city when the wall fell.

It quickly became a second home for artists like Juan Atkins, Jeff Mills and Blake Baxter, as well as countless German DJs. Directed by Tilmann Künzel, SubBerlin traces the club's history from its beginning in the early '90s to the closure of its original location in 2005. It includes interviews with many of the artists that played at the venue, from Atkins to Sven Vath, as well as the people that made the club happen, such as original founder Dimitri Hegemann.",documentary
